Hamming distance between two bytes is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits differ. For a stream of bytes, of equal lengths, it is the sum of Hamming Distances between the corresponding bytes. Finding differences between bits can be efficiently done using bitwise XOR operation as the operation yields 0 when both the bits are the same and 1 when they differ. So for computing Hamming Distance between two bytes we XOR the bytes and count the number of 1 in its binary representation. In order to recover the original text from the cipher, we first find the length of the encryption key used and then apply brute force with all possible keys of the estimated length and deduce the plain text. Finding the length of the Encryption key makes the deciphering process quicker as it eliminates a lot of false keys and thus reducing the overall effort required during the brute force. In order to find the length of the Encryption Key, we need to have a better understanding of a seemingly unrelated topic - Hamming Distance.
